# Python-Speech-Transcriptoin-API
This API give you a speaker seperated transcript given an mp4 video file as input

## Project Highlights

- Utilizes advanced speech processing techniques to achieve high performance
- Provides tools and models for speech recognition, speaker verification, and other related tasks
- Includes a pre-trained model called "Whisper" for speech recognition

## Whisper Model

The "Whisper" model is a highly advanced and pre-trained speech recognition model that has been trained on a vast amount of audio data. It leverages unsupervised pre-training techniques to learn high-quality representations of speech from raw audio. The model has been fine-tuned and optimized for accurate and robust speech recognition.

## Features and Functionality

- Accurate and robust speech recognition
- Support for multiple languages and dialects
- Integration with various speech-related applications and systems
- Efficient and scalable for large-scale speech processing tasks
